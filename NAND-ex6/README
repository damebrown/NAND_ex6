Submitted Files
---------------
README - description of the project
Makefile - make command will make assembler command possible
Assembler.sh - runs the python script on the intended folder/file
Main.py - uses other files to execute the Assembler process in the right sequence
file_parser.py - manages the directory/file parsing (reading/writing/extracting a
		list of files from a directory)
first_pass.py - cleans comments and labels and generates a symbol table full of 
		predefined symbols joined with the label symbols created by this pass
second_pass.py - recieves a clean code file from first_pass and translates each instruction
		to its binary equivilant along with variable initialization in the
		symbol table (when needed)
regex_patterns.py - holds the regex patterns we used to verify the code lines
conversion_tables.py - hold the conversion tables used to convert A/C instructions
		to the binary form
